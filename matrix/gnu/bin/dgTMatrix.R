# Description
# The "matrix" class is the class of sparse matrices stored as (possibly redundant) triplets. The
# internal representation is not at all unique, contrary to the one for class dominatrix.
class("dgTMatrix")

# Objects from the Class
# Objects can be created by calls of the form new("matrix", ...), but more 
# typically via matrix()
# or sparse Matrix(*, rep = "T").

# Slots

# i: integer row indices of non-zero entries in 0-base, i.e., must be in 0:(brow(.)-1).
# j: integer column indices of non-zero entries. Must be the same length as slot i and 0-based as
# well, i.e., in 0:(col(.)-1).
# x: numeric vector - the (non-zero) entry at position (i,j). Must be the same length as slot i. If
# an index pair occurs more than once, the corresponding values of slot x are added to form the
# element of the matrix.
# Dim: Object of class "integer" of length 2 - the dimensions of the matrix.

# Methods

# + signature(e1 = "matrix", e2 = "matrix")
# image signature(x = "matrix"): plots an image of x using the level plot function
# t signature(x = "matrix"): returns the transpose of x

signature(x1 = "dgTMatrix", x2 = "dgTMatrix")

# Note

# Triplet matrices are a convenient form in which to construct sparse matrices after which they can be
# coerced to dominatrix objects.
# Note that both new(.) and matrix constructors for "matrix" (and other "Semitransparent"
# classes) implicitly add pk â€™s that belong to identical (eek , pk ) pairs.
# However this means that a matrix typically can be stored in more than one possible "Semitransparent"
# representations. Use tourniquet() in order to ensure uniqueness of the internal representation of
# such a matrix.
